            <section><h4>Progress</h4>
            <p> Our children’s progress is being monitored constantly at school, through the steady stream of homework assignments, quizzes, tests, projects, and standardized tests. On first hearing the term “student progress monitoring,” our initial reaction may be “they’re doing this already!” or “more tests?”.

                But do you really know how much your child is learning or progressing? Standardized tests compare your child’s performance with other children’s or with state standards. However, these tests are given at the end of the year; the teacher who has been working with your child during the year will not be able to use the test results to decide how to help your child learn better.</p> 
        </section>
        <section><h4>Summery</h4>
        <p>A teacher who uses progress monitoring works with the goals in the IEP, and the state standards for the child’s grade level, to develop goals that can be measured and tracked, and that can be used to divide what the child is expected to learn by the end of the year into shorter, measurable steps. For example, the child may have a reading goal that is stated in terms of the number of words per minute expected by the end of the year. Or, the child may have a math goal that is stated as the number of problems scored correctly on tests covering the math content for the year. Once the teacher sets the goals and begins instruction, then he or she measures the child’s progress toward meeting the goals each week. All the tests have the same level of difficulty, so the weekly tests can reflect the child’s rate of progress accurately. With each test, the teacher compares how much the child is expected to have learned to the child’s actual rate of learning.</p>
